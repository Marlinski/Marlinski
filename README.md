## Lucien Loiseau (Marlinski) 👨‍💻

I'm currently doing AI Research on the topic of inferencing 🚀 and agentization 🤖 to bring us *machines of loving grace*.

I love to learn and pushing tech to the limit with a sense of purpose. I've previously:

- Built the next IoT infrastructure using Blockchain ⛓️ because **DePIN**!
- Develop a Contact-Tracing solution to fight Covid 🦠 using advanced cryptography, bluetooth and mobile phones 📱 because a pandemic shouldn't be fought at the cost of our **privacy** 🕶️!
- Designed wireless Mesh Networks 📡 and Delay Tolerant Networking protocols to **free** the Internet
- Passionately crafted the first (and only) **off-the-grid** decentralized social network on mobile, still thinks it is a great idea though it did not catch💡
- Contributed to **science** getting an inch further during my PhD 🎓 at Institut Mines Telecom.
