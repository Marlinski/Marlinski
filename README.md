## Lucien Loiseau (Marlinski) 👨‍💻

I'm currently doing AI Research Engineering especially on the topic of inferencing 🚀 and agentization 🤖.

I love to learn and pushing tech to the limit with a sense of purpose. I've previously:

- Built the next IoT infrastructure using Blockchain ⛓️ because DePIN !
- Fought Covid 🦠 with Contact-Tracing using advanced cryptography with bluetooth and mobile phones 📱 because a pandemic shouldn't be fought at the cost of our privacy 🕶️!
- Designed wireless Mesh Networks 📡 and Delay Tolerant Networking protocols to free the Internet
- Built the first (and only) off-the-grid decentralized social network on mobile, still thinks it is a great idea though it did not catch💡
- Contributed to science getting an inch further during my PhD 🎓 at Institut Mines Telecom.
